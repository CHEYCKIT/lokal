// Page polish: pages keep what they last showed, and only fade in once they
// have something real to show.
//
// Every page fetches its data when it mounts, so it used to paint its empty
// state first ("No tracks yet", "Folder not set", "Loading artists..."), then
// swap in the data a few frames later. Two small tools fix that:
//
//   useCachedState  a useState that remembers its value across visits, so
//                   coming back to a page paints the last data on frame one
//                   (and the page still refetches it quietly).
//   usePageReady    tells the route transition the page has its data; the
//                   page stays invisible until then (or PAGE_READY_TIMEOUT_MS,
//                   so a slow load never hides a page for long).
